<h1>Nessus-Vulnerability-Scan</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this cybersecurity project, I conducted a comprehensive scanning and vulnerability assessment of the web infrastructure belonging to Sanofi, a prominent multinational pharmaceutical company engaged in various facets of healthcare. The primary objective was to identify and analyze potential vulnerabilities in the organization's web servers, with a focus on addressing critical issues that could compromise sensitive data.

<h2>Assessment</h2>
The organization is at serious risk of security breaches due to the presence of critical vulnerabilities in its Apache HTTP Server software. These vulnerabilities could allow attackers to launch Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, which would overwhelm the server and make it unavailable to legitimate users, or Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks, which could allow attackers to control the server and execute arbitrary commands. The organization's HTTPS server is also vulnerable to attack because it does not have HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) enabled. HSTS instructs web browsers to always connect to the server over HTTPS, even if the user types in an HTTP URL. This helps to protect against attacks that downgrade security to HTTP, such as man-in-the-middle attacks. Without HSTS, sensitive data could be exposed to potential attackers.
<h2>Recommendation</h2>
1.	Apache HTTP Server: Our organization should prioritize updating all Apache servers. This will automatically address critical vulnerabilities mentioned in table 1.
2.	HSTS Configuration: Upgrading to HSTS (HyperText Strict Transport Security) will better the HTPPS connection, hence preventing man-in-the-middle attack and downgrade attacks.
3.	Regular Vulnerability Scanning: Regular scans can help identify new security weaknesses as they arise and enable proactive measures to minimize risks.
4.	Patch Management: Having and implementing robust patch management procedures and rules will reduce the chances of exposure to vulnerabilities.
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
It is essential to address the critical vulnerabilities found in the Apache HTTP Server and implement HSTS in the organization's web servers to strengthen the security posture. Immediate action should be taken to update and patch vulnerable systems, and ongoing security measures should be implemented to prevent the emergence of new vulnerabilities. A proactive approach to security is crucial to protect the organization's digital assets and data.
